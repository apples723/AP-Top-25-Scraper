# AP-Top-25-Scraper
A crappy web scraper I wrote in Python to scrap ESPN for the AP Top 25 rankings. 
### What does it do? 
Right now all it does is scrap ESPN.com for the College FB AP Top 25 rankings for every week of every year on their site. It will dynamicaly update to the current availible weeks for the year. It will also grab the latest year. It will go back as far as ESPN has data for. No url is hard coded.
### Why?
No specific reason, I have aspiration to make it text me every week with the new Top 25, however I haven't had the time to implement that.
